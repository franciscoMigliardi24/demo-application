# demo-application

On the folder `demo` there is the back-end application, run it on the port 8080.
It does not require any database, it is just a simple REST API.

On the folder `demo-vue` there is the front-end application, run it on any port (apart from the port 8080).
Then open a browser and go to `http://localhost:PORT/` to see the application.

Sorry for the luck of tests, I did not have time to write them.

Or the luck of style on the front-end..

Or the luck of comments on the back-end..

Or the luck of a better README file..

I can continue and continue XD but I liked the challenge.
